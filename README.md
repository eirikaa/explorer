# Explorer

Explorer is an app inspired by real-time strategy games like Age of empires, Rust, Civilization etc.
With a blank map, it is the user's task to explore the world.

The app is a product of [Hack4no](www.hack4.no). A hackathon arranged by [The Norwegian Mapping Authority](www.kartverket.no).
[Project description](https://devpost.com/software/explorers).

The app is built with the [Leaflet](www.leafletjs.com) library.
